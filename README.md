# Geyser-Controller
**GEYSER CONTROLLER**

**BACKGROUND**
I had been contemplating building my own Geyser (Boiler) Controller for several years, but I never had the time to get seriously involved. When the Covid lockdown started I decided this was the ideal opportunity to start developing the project in earnest. 

**DESIGN**
The hardware took several design iterations to baseline. There was also a significant time spent on writing code and error checking to make the code “bullet proof”. 

Initially the idea was just to switch the geyser ON/OFF using a scheduler but as the project developed I thought it would be neat to added a power monitoring circuit as well, this added a whole new dimension of what could be done.. 

The design is based on the ESP-12F WiFi platform and using the Blynk App to manage your schedule and actively monitor your power consumption. The hardware is built into a 32mm wide Din Rail Housing that can be easily wired up into your Distribution Board. 

**DIY**
DIY Partly built up SMD boards or a completed unit is available if your are interested in supporting my project. Hell I may even be able to quit my forced retirement!! The project is complex, you will need a certain level of skill in Electronics and be familiar with writing code using the Arduino IDE and using Blynk.
